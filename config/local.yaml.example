# local.yaml.example, if you'd like to override the settings in common.yaml, 
# this is how you do it. Just rename this file to local.yaml and you're in 
# business. 

# The file local.yaml is in .gitignore, so you won't accidentally commit it.

# First, you're probably going to want to work with your OWN fork of DSpace, 
# not the official DSpace repository, so just change the git_repo to match your
# fork. The example below won't work until you edit it.

# This is a hack, we'd like for there to be a better way to determine where the
# ant installer ends up after running mvn package, but, for now, we're hard 
# coding it. See DS-1760, and pitch in if you have a solution.
