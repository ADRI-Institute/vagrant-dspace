DSpace Source Directory
================================

After running `vagrant up`, this `dspace-src` folder will contain 
a full copy of the DSpace source directory that was installed on
your Virtual Machine (VM).

You can use your IDE of choice on the host machine to modify the
contents of this `dspace-src` folder as you see fit.  

This directory is also automatically mounted as the `~/dspace-src` folder
on your VM. Simply login using `vagrant ssh` to check it out!
