DSpace Installation Directory
================================

After running `vagrant up`, this `dspace` folder will contain 
a full copy of the DSpace installation directory which is running
in your Virtual Machine (VM).

This directory is also automatically mounted as the `~/dspace` folder
on your VM. Simply login using `vagrant ssh` to check it out!
